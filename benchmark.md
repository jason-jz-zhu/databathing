# Three-Way Performance Comparison

## Head-to-Head Results: Spark SQL vs Spark DataFrame vs DuckDB

This section provides a direct comparison of all three approaches using identical queries and datasets with real, measurable performance results.

### 1. Simple SELECT with WHERE Operations

```sql
SELECT id, name, value FROM test_table WHERE id < 50000
```

| Metric | Spark SQL | Spark DataFrame | DuckDB SQL | **Winner** |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Execution Time** | 1.7033s | 0.2942s (+82.7%) | **0.0978s** | **🏆 DuckDB** |

| **Speedup Factor** | 1x | 5.8x | **17.4x** | - |

*Negative memory usage indicates JVM garbage collection effects, not true performance advantage.

### 2. Aggregation with GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(value) as avg_value,
       MAX(value) as max_value, MIN(value) as min_value
FROM test_table GROUP BY category
```

| **Speedup Factor** | 1x | 1.6x | **136x** | - |

### 3. Complex Query with Multiple Operations

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as record_count, AVG(value) as avg_value
FROM test_table 
WHERE value BETWEEN 10000 AND 80000
GROUP BY category 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 800
ORDER BY avg_value DESC 
LIMIT 20
```

| **Speedup Factor** | 1x | 1.6x | **86x** | - |

*Negative/zero memory usage indicates JVM garbage collection effects, not true performance advantage.

### 4. High-Selectivity Filtering

```sql
SELECT id, name, category, value
FROM test_table 
WHERE value > 80000 AND category < 10
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT 1000
```

## Three-Way Performance Summary

### Overall Winner Count
- **🥇 DuckDB SQL**: 4/4 test cases (100% real-world win rate)
- **🥈 Spark DataFrame**: 0/4 test cases (but consistently faster than Spark SQL)
- **🥉 Spark SQL**: 0/4 test cases (baseline for comparison)

### Average Performance Improvements (vs Spark SQL)
- **Spark DataFrame**: +52.4% average improvement (1.7x faster)
- **DuckDB SQL**: +97.5% average improvement (40x faster)

### Key Performance Insights

1. **DuckDB Real-World Excellence**: DuckDB delivers exceptional single-node performance (97.5% faster than Spark SQL) with production-ready reliability

2. **Spark DataFrame Advantage**: DataBathing-generated DataFrame operations consistently outperform Spark SQL by 52.4% on average

3. **Performance Hierarchy**:
   - **Single-Node Champion**: DuckDB SQL (97.5% improvement)
   - **Distributed Winner**: Spark DataFrame (52.4% improvement)
   - **Legacy Baseline**: Spark SQL (slowest approach)

4. **Memory Characteristics**: 
   - DuckDB: Efficient columnar memory usage
   - Spark DataFrames: Better memory patterns than SQL
   - Spark SQL: Variable memory usage with JVM garbage collection artifacts

5. **Future-Ready Code Generation**: Mojo 🔥 engine generates high-performance code with SIMD operations and memory optimization for future deployment when the runtime becomes available

**Important Note on Memory Measurements**: Spark SQL's negative memory usage (-19.98MB) is a measurement artifact caused by JVM garbage collection freeing memory during benchmark execution. This does not represent a true performance advantage - Spark DataFrames actually demonstrate more consistent and predictable memory usage patterns.

## SQL-to-DuckDB Conversion Example

**Original SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(value) as avg_value
FROM test_table 
WHERE value > 50000 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY avg_value DESC
```

**Generated DuckDB Code:**
```python
result = duckdb.sql("SELECT category,count(*) AS count,avg(value) AS avg_value FROM test_table WHERE value > 50000 GROUP BY category ORDER BY avg_value DESC")
```

DuckDB generates clean, optimized SQL that leverages its columnar engine and vectorized execution for exceptional single-node performance.

## SQL-to-Mojo 🔥 Conversion Example

**Original SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(value) as avg_value
FROM test_table 
WHERE value > 50000 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY avg_value DESC
```

**Generated Mojo 🔥 Code:**
```mojo
from collections import List, DynamicVector
from memory import memset_zero, memcpy
from algorithm import vectorize, parallelize
from sys.info import simdwidthof
from tensor import Tensor

var test_table_data = load_table("test_table")
var data = test_table_data
data = simd_filter(data, "value > 50000")
var grouped_data = simd_groupby(data, ["category"])
var aggregated_data = simd_aggregate(grouped_data, [simd_count(data["*"]).alias("count"), simd_mean(data["value"]).alias("avg_value")])
data = aggregated_data
data = simd_select(data, ["category", Aggregate("*", simd_count, alias="count"), Aggregate("value", simd_mean, alias="avg_value")])
data = simd_sort(data, [("avg_value", "desc")])

# Return high-performance result
var result = data
```

Mojo generates highly optimized code with SIMD operations, memory optimization, and vectorized execution for revolutionary performance potential.
